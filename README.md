This project aims to compose a table of contents for Esther Dyson's Release 1.0 Newsletter

[Current state of the catalogue](https://davidmendelovits.github.io/release1.0/)

So far we have a rough idea of where to find the table of contents - however, reading pdf provides a non-standard text input, so we will have to read and infer to get a good estimate

-scrape all pdfs by year X

-gather ToC as list of headers X
 
-bonus, get page numbers X 

-assemble web page to display links with ToC (mostly there)

to do: 
  style components
  add author field
  sort by date
