This project aims to compose a table of contents for Esther Dyson's Release 1.0 Newsletter

So far we have a rough idea of where to find the table contents however, there is no standard line by line, so we will have to read and infer to get a good estimate

-scrape all pdfs by year
-gather ToC as list of headers
    -bonus, get page numbers
-assemble web page to display links with ToC
